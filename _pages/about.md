<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am a <strong>Postdoctoral Associate</strong> at the <strong>University of Georgia</strong> (<a href="https://www.uga.edu/">UGA</a>), working in the laboratory of <a href="https://esbgkannan.github.io/">Dr. Kannan</a> on problems centered around <strong>kinase biology and regulation</strong>. My research lies at the intersection of <strong>computational biology, molecular simulations, and artificial intelligence</strong>, with a strong emphasis on integrating <strong>data-driven and physics-based approaches</strong> to study protein dynamics.</p>

<h2>Research Overview</h2>

<p>My overarching research goal is to develop <strong>scalable, automated, and interpretable computational frameworks</strong> that combine <strong>AI/ML, agentic AI systems, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</strong> to address fundamental questions in <strong>protein structure, dynamics, and function</strong>. I combine <strong>data-driven and physics-based methods</strong> to move beyond static structural descriptions toward <strong>predictive and mechanistic models</strong> of biomolecular behaviour.</p>

<h2>Current research</h2>

<p>At the University of Georgia I focus on the <strong>dynamic regulation of kinases</strong>, investigating how <strong>conformational heterogeneity and disordered regions</strong> influence enzymatic activity and signaling.</p>

<p>My current work integrates <strong>three complementary computational paradigms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Agentic AI systems to automate and orchestrate complex research pipelines (simulation setup, analysis, and interpretation).</li>
  <li>AI/ML models for data-driven analysis of large-scale simulation and structural datasets.</li>
  <li>Molecular dynamics simulations for physics-based investigation of conformational landscapes and allosteric mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p>By unifying these approaches I aim to produce <strong>interpretable, scalable workflows</strong> that reveal <strong>mechanisms of kinase regulation</strong>.</p>

<h2>Postdoctoral Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy</h2>

After completing my Ph.D., I continued my research at the <a href="https://iitbmonash.org/">IITB–Monash Research Academy</a> supported by MDFI. There I expanded my focus on developing <strong>machine learning models for generative peptide design</strong> (amyloidogenic and antimicrobial peptides). This work marked my initial transition into <strong>AI-driven biomolecular modeling</strong> and shaped my longer-term research trajectory.

<h2>Ph.D. Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy</h2>

I began my doctoral studies in 2019 at the <strong>IITB–Monash Research Academy</strong>, a joint program between IIT Bombay (India) and Monash University (Australia). My doctoral research focused on:

- <strong>Structural dynamics of peptides</strong>
- <strong>Peptide aggregation and amyloid formation</strong>
- <strong>Structure–aggregation relationships</strong> in biologically relevant systems

Methodologies used included <strong>molecular dynamics simulations, biophysical experiments</strong> (CD, FTIR, DLS, TIRF), <strong>Python/Tcl programming</strong>, and <strong>bioinformatics-driven data analysis</strong>.
