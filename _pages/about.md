<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Georgia (<a href="https://www.uga.edu/">UGA</a>), working in the laboratory of <a href="https://esbgkannan.github.io/">Dr. Kannan</a> on problems centered around kinase biology and regulation. My research lies at the intersection of computational biology, molecular simulations, and artificial intelligence, with a strong emphasis on integrating data-driven and physics-based approaches to study protein dynamics.</p>

<h2>Research Overview</h2>

<p>My overarching research goal is to develop scalable, automated, and interpretable computational frameworks that combine AI/ML, agentic AI systems, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to address fundamental questions in protein structure, dynamics, and function. I combine data-driven and physics-based methods to move beyond static structural descriptions toward predictive and mechanistic models of biomolecular behaviour.</p>

<h2>Current research</h2>

<p>At the University of Georgia I focus on the dynamic regulation of kinases, investigating how conformational heterogeneity and disordered regions influence enzymatic activity and signaling.</p>

<p>My current work integrates three complementary computational paradigms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Agentic AI systems to automate and orchestrate complex research pipelines (simulation setup, analysis, and interpretation).</li>
  <li>AI/ML models for data-driven analysis of large-scale simulation and structural datasets.</li>
  <li>Molecular dynamics simulations for physics-based investigation of conformational landscapes and allosteric mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p>By unifying these approaches I aim to produce interpretable, scalable workflows that reveal mechanisms of kinase regulation.</p>

<h2>Postdoctoral Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy</h2>

After completing my Ph.D., I continued my research at the <a href="https://iitbmonash.org/">IITB–Monash Research Academy</a> supported by MDFI. There I expanded my focus on developing machine learning models for generative peptide design (amyloidogenic and antimicrobial peptides). This work marked my initial transition into AI-driven biomolecular modeling and shaped my longer-term research trajectory.

<h2>Ph.D. Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy</h2>

I began my doctoral studies in 2019 at the IITB–Monash Research Academy, a joint program between IIT Bombay (India) and Monash University (Australia). My doctoral research focused on:

- Structural dynamics of peptides
- Peptide aggregation and amyloid formation
- Structure–aggregation relationships in biologically relevant systems

Methodologies used included molecular dynamics simulations, biophysical experiments (CD, FTIR, DLS, TIRF), Python/Tcl programming, and bioinformatics-driven data analysis.
