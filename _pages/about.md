<div class="with-univ-bg">

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Georgia (<a href="https://www.uga.edu/">UGA</a>), working in the laboratory of <a href="https://esbgkannan.github.io/">Dr. Kannan</a> on problems centered around kinase biology and regulation. My research lies at the intersection of computational biology, molecular simulations, and artificial intelligence, with a strong emphasis on integrating data-driven and physics-based approaches to study protein dynamics.

## Research overview

My overarching research goal is to develop scalable, automated, and interpretable computational frameworks that combine AI/ML, agentic AI systems, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to address fundamental questions in protein structure, dynamics, and function.

I combine data-driven and physics-based methods to move beyond static structural descriptions toward predictive and mechanistic models of biomolecular behaviour.

## Current research

At the University of Georgia I focus on the dynamic regulation of kinases, investigating how conformational heterogeneity and disordered regions influence enzymatic activity and signaling.

My current work integrates three complementary computational paradigms:

- Agentic AI systems to automate and orchestrate complex research pipelines (simulation setup, analysis, and interpretation).
- AI/ML models for data-driven analysis of large-scale simulation and structural datasets.
- Molecular dynamics simulations for physics-based investigation of conformational landscapes and allosteric mechanisms.

By unifying these approaches I aim to produce interpretable, scalable workflows that reveal mechanisms of kinase regulation.

## Past research experience

### Postdoctoral Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy

After completing my Ph.D., I continued my research at the <a href="https://iitbmonash.org/">IITB–Monash Research Academy</a> supported by MDFI. There I expanded my focus on integrating AI and molecular dynamics to study complex biomolecular systems. Key outcomes included:

- AI-driven analysis of molecular simulation data
- Coupling ML models with physics-based simulations
- Designing computational pipelines for large-scale, reproducible research

This period provided the foundation for my current work on agentic AI frameworks for computational biology.

### Ph.D. Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy

I began my doctoral studies in 2019 at the IITB–Monash Research Academy, a joint program between IIT Bombay (India) and Monash University (Australia). My doctoral research focused on:

- Structural dynamics of peptides
- Peptide aggregation and amyloid formation
- Structure–aggregation relationships in biologically relevant systems

Methodologies used included molecular dynamics simulations, biophysical experiments (CD, FTIR, DLS, TIRF), Python/Tcl programming, and bioinformatics-driven data analysis.

### Earlier research — IIT Bombay

Prior to and during my Ph.D., I worked at IIT Bombay developing machine learning models for generative peptide design (amyloidogenic and antimicrobial peptides). This work marked my initial transition into AI-driven biomolecular modeling and shaped my longer-term research trajectory.

If you would like me to highlight specific publications, datasets, or figures on this page (or add links to slides and code), tell me which items to surface and I will add them.
