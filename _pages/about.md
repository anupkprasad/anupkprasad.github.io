<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am a Postdoctoral Associate at <strong>The University of Georgia</strong> (<a href="https://www.uga.edu/">UGA</a>), working in the laboratory of <a href="https://esbgkannan.github.io/">Dr. Kannan</a> on problems centered around kinase biology and regulation. My research lies at the intersection of <strong>computational biology, molecular simulations, and artificial intelligence</strong>, with a strong emphasis on integrating data-driven and physics-based approaches to study protein dynamics.</p>

<h2>Research Overview</h2>

<p>My overarching research goal is to develop scalable, automated, and interpretable computational frameworks that combine <strong>Machine Learning, Agentic AI, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</strong> to address fundamental questions in protein structure, dynamics, and function. I combine data-driven and physics-based methods to move beyond static structural descriptions toward predictive and mechanistic models of biomolecular behaviour.</p>

<h2>Current research</h2>

<p>At The University of Georgia I focus on the dynamic regulation of kinases, investigating how conformational heterogeneity and disordered regions influence enzymatic activity and signaling.</p>

<p>My current work integrates three complementary computational paradigms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI systems</strong> to automate and orchestrate complex research pipelines (simulation setup, analysis, and interpretation).</li>
  <li><strong>AI/ML</strong> models for data-driven analysis of large-scale simulation and structural datasets.</li>
  <li><strong>Molecular dynamics simulations</strong> for physics-based investigation of conformational landscapes and allosteric mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p>By unifying these approaches I aim to produce interpretable, scalable workflows that reveal mechanisms of kinase regulation.</p>

<p>After completing my Ph.D., I continued my research at the <a href="https://iitbmonash.org/">IITB–Monash Research Academy</a> supported by MDFI. There I expanded my focus on developing machine learning models for generative peptide design <strong>(amyloidogenic and antimicrobial peptides)</strong>. This work marked my initial transition into AI-driven biomolecular modeling and shaped my longer-term research trajectory.</p>

<h2>Ph.D. Research — IITB–Monash Research Academy</h2>

<p>I began my doctoral studies in 2019 at the <strong>IITB–Monash Research Academy</strong>, a joint program between IIT Bombay (India) and Monash University (Australia). My doctoral research focused on:

- Structural dynamics of peptides
- Peptide aggregation and amyloid formation
- Structure–aggregation relationships in biologically relevant systems

Methodologies used included molecular dynamics simulations, biophysical experiments <strong>(CD, FTIR, DLS, TIRF)</strong>, Python/Tcl/Bash programming for simulation and data analysis.</p>
