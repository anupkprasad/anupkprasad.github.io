# Gallery images

Drop your gallery images here. Recommended filenames (so they appear in the order you want):

- fig1.png
- fig2.png
- fig3.png
- fig4.png
- fig5.png

You can add more images; the gallery page will show anything under `images/gallery/` with common image extensions (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, svg).

If you prefer PNGs specifically, upload files named `fig1.png` ... `fig5.png`. The repository already contains placeholder SVGs (fig1.svg..fig5.svg) which are lightweight and will display until you replace them with your real PNG images.
